# TrajAgent: An Agent Framework for Unified Trajectory Modelling

# Introduction
Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modelling. However, due to the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks, achieving unified trajectory modelling remains an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, a large language model-based agentic framework, to unify various trajectory modelling tasks. In TrajAgent, we first develop UniEnv, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on UniEnv, we introduce TAgent, an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modelling across various trajectory tasks. Specifically, we design AutOpt, a systematic optimization module within TAgent, to further improve the performance of the integrated model. With diverse trajectory tasks input in natural language, TrajAgent automatically generates competitive results via training and executing appropriate models. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajAgent in unified trajectory modelling, achieving an average performance improvement of 15.43% over baseline methods.
